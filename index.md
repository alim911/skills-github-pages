- Hi, I'm Andrew Lim.
- I'm interested in learning software development with the goal of becoming a developer in the future.
- I'm currently learning Python and Django and I'm working on different projects that I'll continue to add here.
- Once I get more experience, my goal is to collaborate on and contribute to various open source projects.
